## Useful website for listening to pronunciations

Forvo.com is a website where you can listen to people pronounce words in almost any language.

You must register with the website before you can use it. You normally have to provide a username (not your email address), a location which is done by moving a pin over a map to the location you are from and state the language you are studying.

Be careful when entering words as the application is looking for exact matches. Some Italian words are spelt in exactly the same way as words in other countries so make sure the words you are listening to are in Italian.

If you cannot find a word and are sure you have spelt it correctly you can request someone provides a pronunciation. You will be notified if someone does pronounce the word for you.

As well as listening to people pronounce words, you can download words and expressions to your computer - the format of the downloaded file is mp3.
