1.  Ten Italian Ballads - site with what are supposedly the Top Ten Best Italian Ballads around and some seem to be in English (??!)

    http://www.toptenz.net/top-10-italian-songs.php

2.  Signora Maestro is an amusing traditional folk song / ballad found on youtube. Stay on this site and just listen to whatever else comes up.

    Same song but by an Italian singer rather than by an Irish (?American) Folk Group. Again stay on site as there are loads of other songs!!

    Overall a little fast so may be difficult to pick some bits up until you get used to listening to it.
