## Learning Tools

1.  Anki is a program that allows you to create your own flash cards and review them on a regular basis. The cards can include images and sounds to help you remember words and facts. It takes a bit of work to set it up but you can also link it to your phone or iPad etc. There are decks (packs) of cards available on all sorts of subjects - a lot are free but some you have to pay for. If you are going to use this site I would set up the cards for yourself as that way you will only be prompted for stuff you are learning on the course.
