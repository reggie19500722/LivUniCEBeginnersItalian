## General

Il Tavolo Italiano seems to be a site for Italian learners with links to lots of other sites. Just be aware that not all the links work.

http://iltavoloitaliano.com/

Another site with general things Italian is Italian101. Here's the link:

http://www.101languages.net/italian/

Now, this next site has been suggested by Renzo. It is an Italian website for foreigners who are learning Italian. You may find some of its contents a bit hard to follow but, if you look under the Resources tab (Italiano - Risorse) you will find there are numerous links to videos. Remeber, the objective is to hear Italian being spoken do don't worry about understanding all that is being said.
There are two ways you can access the website:

    1.  This is the link in English http://www.almaedizioni.it/en/
        You must register with this website.
    2.  This is the link all in Italian http://www.almaedizioni.it/it/
        If you register via this link everything will be in Italian. Don't be put off by this though as you can use the dictionary or the google translate link to understand what needs to be entered in each box.
